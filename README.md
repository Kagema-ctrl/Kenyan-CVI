# 🌊 Coastal Vulnerability Mapping in Kenya  
**CVI-Based GIS Assessment of Sea-Level Rise Risks**

---

## 📍 Project Overview

This project evaluates the vulnerability of **Kenya’s coastline** to **sea-level rise (SLR)** by developing a **Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI)**. The CVI combines two key components:

- **🌐 Physical Vulnerability Index (PVI)** – based on coastal slope, geomorphology, and shoreline change  
- **👥 Socioeconomic Vulnerability Index (SoVI)** – based on population density, land use, and infrastructure proximity

By integrating these two dimensions in a GIS environment, the project identifies areas most at risk from rising sea levels.

---

## 📊 Key Findings

- **📈 Average PVI**: 42.38 — indicates a moderate level of physical exposure  
- **🏙️ Average SoVI**: 71.02 — highlights high socioeconomic pressure on coastal regions  
- **⚖️ Overall CVI**: 50.97 — reflects **medium vulnerability** along Kenya's coastline

These results suggest that while natural factors pose moderate risks, human activities significantly amplify the impact of SLR.

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques

- **GIS Software**: ArcGIS Pro / QGIS  
- **Remote Sensing**: Satellite-derived shoreline data  
- **Data Analysis**: Weighted index modeling  
- **Visualization**: Thematic maps for spatial interpretation

---

## 🌍 Why It Matters

This CVI-based approach helps:
- Identify **high-risk coastal zones**  
- Support **data-driven planning** and **climate adaptation**  
- Guide **targeted interventions** to reduce SLR impacts on both people and infrastructure
